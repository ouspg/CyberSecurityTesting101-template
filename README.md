# Your place for returning weekly exercises on course IC00AI82 Introduction to Cyber Security Testing 

**Student name:** 

*Give at least the above information to this file. You can remove all of below if you like, and add some general instructions/information if you like.*


## What is this repository for?

This repository is meant to return all of the weekly **advanced and essay-based tasks** from exercises during the course. 
This repository should be private and invisible to others, except course organizers.

The actual instructions for the exercises are [here.](https://github.com/ouspg/CyberSecurityTesting101)

You should only need this single repository for adding all of your other work than automatically graded assignments.


## How to proceed?

There is a corresponding folder for each exercise in this repository.

There is a template for text (README.md) in each template folder. You can fill it as you like, but include at least task numbers and possible sub-numbers, answering what is required on the corresponding task.

You can create a folder named *src* for possible source code in each folder.

You can create a folder named *img* for possible images/screenshots in each folder.

It is recommended to do as described above, but it is not required (= you can add more things if you like).


Check the [cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) if you need a refresher on how to use Git. 

If you have barely edited Markdown files, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good free software for editing and showing a live preview of it. 
It works on Windows, Linux and Mac. 
It is also installed on the course virtual machine.

You can look for a short guide on Markdown syntax available [here.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## When to proceed?

There is a deadline for each weekly exercise.

When you have done the exercises of the corresponding week, you have to return the link (URL) of this repository into [Moodle](https://moodle.oulu.fi) into the corresponding returning box ***before the deadline***.

Note: You can return a link beforehand and edit the corresponding exercise still here, as long as it has been done before the deadline.

In practice, if you have done all of the seven (7) exercises, you return this same link seven (7) times for different return boxes.

This is because:

 * We can track if you have done the corresponding exercise each time. We know that there is something to review.

 * We can link the correct person to the correct repository (= We know, who has actually edited this repository)

 * There are people, who might only take weekly questionnaires or automatically graded ones

 * Private GitHub repositories can be more accessible than one hundred zip files.
